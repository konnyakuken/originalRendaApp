/// A protocol that defines how to execute a task.
///
/// This protocol has extension methods that allow to launch coroutines on a current scheduler.
/// Inside the coroutine you can use such methods as `Coroutine.await(_:)`, `CoFuture.await()`,
/// and `CoroutineScheduler.await(_:)` to suspend the coroutine without blocking a thread
/// and resume it when the result is ready.
///
/// To launch a coroutine, use `CoroutineScheduler.startCoroutine(_:)`.
/// ```
/// //execute coroutine on the main thread
/// DispatchQueue.main.startCoroutine {
///
///     //extension that returns CoFuture<(data: Data, response: URLResponse)>
///     let dataFuture = URLSession.shared.dataTaskFuture(for: url)
///
///     //await result that suspends coroutine and doesn't block the thread
///     let data = try dataFuture.await().data
///
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The framework includes the implementation of this protocol for `DispatchQueue`
/// and you can easily make the same for other schedulers as well.
/// ```
